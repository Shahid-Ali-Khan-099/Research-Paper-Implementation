Machine learning (ML) offers a transformative approach to heart disease prediction by addressing the limitations of traditional methods. ML algorithms excel at analyzing complex, multi-dimensional datasets, identifying hidden patterns, and delivering personalized risk estimations. Unlike conventional models that rely on limited variables, ML incorporates genetic, lifestyle, and social determinants of health to enhance accuracy. Techniques such as deep learning enable early detection of structural changes in the heart through medical imaging, while wearable devices process real-time health data to predict risks dynamically. This integration of diverse data streams facilitates rapid, precise diagnoses and holds immense potential for advancing early intervention and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.


# Results and Discussion

The performance of various machine learning models for predicting outcomes is summarized as follows. The Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (73.09%) and the best ROC-AUC score (0.7979), demonstrating its superior ability to distinguish between classes. XGBoost and AdaBoost closely followed, with accuracies of 73.06% and 72.79%, respectively, and strong ROC-AUC scores (0.7958 and 0.7915). The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) also performed well, with an accuracy of 72.20% and a ROC-AUC score of 0.7809, showing effectiveness in capturing complex patterns.

Other models, such as Logistic Regression (71.27% accuracy, 0.7775 ROC-AUC), Random Forest (71.19% accuracy, 0.7664 ROC-AUC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (69.29% accuracy, 0.7409 ROC-AUC), delivered moderate performance. Simpler models like Naive Bayes struggled, with both accuracy (57.94%) and ROC-AUC (0.6709), indicating limitations in handling the datasetâ€™s complexities.

# EDA and Preprocessing Explanation 

The dataset was already in numerical form, with no missing values or categorical features requiring encoding. As a result:

# EDA: 

Exploratory data analysis was unnecessary for this dataset as it was clean and structured. ColumnTransformer and FunctionTransformer: These tools were not applicable due to the absence of categorical or missing data. Pipeline: A pipeline was not required because no additional preprocessing steps were needed before model training.

# Challenges and Efforts 

Despite multiple attempts to improve accuracy through hyperparameter tuning, adjustments to model parameters, and trying different algorithms, no significant improvement in accuracy could be achieved. This indicates the dataset might have inherent limitations, such as a lack of complex patterns or insufficient features, that restrict further performance enhancement.
